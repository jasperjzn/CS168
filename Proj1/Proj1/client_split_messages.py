"""
A client that sends messages to a server that are split into messages
smaller than the default message length.  This client can be used to
test that the server correctly buffers when it receives partial messages.
This client assumes that the server has an existing channel called
split_messages.  To use this client, you should connect another client
to the server, and have that client create (and join) a split_messages
channel.  Then, you should ensure that the other client sees this output
10 times:
[SplitMessagesChatClient] I think that I shall never see a structure more wasteful than a tree. Most links remain idle and unused while others are overloaded and abused. And with each failure comes disruption caused by...
You may want to modify this client to test a broader range of scenarios
with split messages.  This client randomly determines how to split up
a message, but you may want to hard-code the way messages are divided to
ensure that you've tested all relevant cases.
